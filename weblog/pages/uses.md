# Uses

Things and software that I use regularly.

### Hardware
- Mac Mini (2018 - Intel)
- Dell Monitor (5ish years old and going strong)
- Apple Magic Keyboard
- Apple Magic Trackpad
- Homepod Mini for audio
- Raspberry Pi for Homebridge

### Software
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) + [Dracula Pro](https://draculatheme.com/pro) - I prefer Sublime Text for it's responsiveness and lightweight approach to editing (while also being extensible due to its a rich plugin ecosystem). Dracula Pro has become my go-to syntax theme everywhere it's available.
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) - my preferred macOS terminal emulator.
- [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com) - My favorite Spotlight replacement. The flexibility, speed and wide array of workflows make it incredibly useful.
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things) - My go to task manager — simple, well-designed and extremely reliable.
- [1Password](https://1password.com) - The best password manager around. I've been using it for 11 years and counting.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) - A powerful and incredibly flexible documentation/note taking tool. I use it for everything from quick notes to web clipping pages to reference later to writing posts for this site.
- [Reader](https://readwise.io/read) - I've moved to Readwise's Reader application for browsing my feeds, saving articles to read, highlight and reference as needed.

### Services
- [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/cory) - my host for this site.
- [Fastmail](https://ref.fm/u28939392) - my choice for an email provider. I've found its features and approach to be the best at managing my email. The company embraces and advances open standards and supports just about any workflow you can imagine for handling email.
- [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/?from=m56mt3z6) - a privacy-focused DNS provider with myriad blocking, caching and security options. I have a baseline profile configured on my home network and a more aggressive one installed via a profile on my devices directly.
- [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com) - primarily as a way to sync music. I import my library and allow Apple to store it rather than leveraging their cataologue.
- [Slack](http://slack.com) - my family has a Slack channel that we use instead of group message threads and I participate in a number of other groups.
- [Plausible](https://plausible.io) - privacy respecting analytics for this site. Feel free to opt out here.
- [Simkl](https://simkl.com) - to keep track of what shows I'm watching.
- [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) - to keep track of what movies I'm watching and seek out recommendations for ones I haven't seen.
- [Oku](https://oku.club) - to track the books I'm reading and discover new ones.
